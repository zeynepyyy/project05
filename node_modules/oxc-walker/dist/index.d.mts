/**
 * Tracks variable scopes and identifier declarations within a JavaScript AST.
 *
 * Maintains a stack of scopes, each represented as a map from identifier names to their declaration nodes,
 * enabling efficient lookup of the declaration.
 *
 * The ScopeTracker is designed to integrate with the `walk` function,
 * it automatically manages scope creation and identifier tracking,
 * so only query and inspection methods are exposed for external use.
 *
 * ### Scope tracking
 * A new scope is created when entering blocks, function parameters, loop variables, etc.
 * Note that this representation may split a single JavaScript lexical scope into multiple internal scopes,
 * meaning it doesn't mirror JavaScript’s scoping 1:1.
 *
 * Scopes are represented using a string-based index like `"0-1-2"`, which tracks depth and ancestry.
 *
 * #### Root scope
 * The root scope is represented by an empty string `""`.
 *
 * #### Scope key format
 * Scope keys are hierarchical strings that uniquely identify each scope and its position in the tree.
 * They are constructed using a depth-based indexing scheme, where:
 *
 * - the root scope is represented by an empty string `""`.
 * - the first child scope is `"0"`.
 * - a parallel sibling of `"0"` becomes `"1"`, `"2"`, etc.
 * - a nested scope under `"0"` is `"0-0"`, then its sibling is `"0-1"`, and so on.
 *
 * Each segment in the key corresponds to the zero-based index of the scope at that depth level in
 * the order of AST traversal.
 *
 * ### Additional features
 * - supports freezing the tracker to allow for second passes through the AST without modifying the scope data
 * (useful for doing a pre-pass to collect all identifiers before walking).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const scopeTracker = new ScopeTracker()
 * walk(code, {
 *   scopeTracker,
 *   enter(node) {
 *     // ...
 *   },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @see parseAndWalk
 * @see walk
